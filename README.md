# Rotating-Tic-Tac-Toe
a X-O game, with a twist!

- There are only 3 X's and O's available.
- Once you place all 3 moves, your next move will remove your *oldest* move, and it will become your newest move.

## Future plans
I’m planning to implement a simple AI opponent so the game can be played in single-player mode. Coming soon!
